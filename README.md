# -Disease-Outcome-Based-on-Genetic-and-Clinical-Data
# 🧬 Disease Outcome Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict disease outcomes based on **genetic** and **clinical data**. By combining patient health records and genetic markers, we aim to enhance early diagnosis and personalized treatment strategies.

## 🚀 Features
- Predict disease status using ML models
- Use of both clinical (e.g., age, gender) and genetic data (e.g., SNPs)
- Evaluation with accuracy, F1 score, and AUC-ROC

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib (for visualization)

## 📂 How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python models/model_training.py
